Currently in the process of redesigning 
[Severe Weather Alerts](https://github.com/qconrad/severe-weather-alerts)
to be more server sided.
This will allow alerts to be more timely and reliable all while improving
battery and data usage. This repository contains node.js code for fetching and
processing weather alerts as well as communicating with the client.
